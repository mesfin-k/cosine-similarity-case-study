# Cosine Similarity Case Study

This repository contains a hands-on case study using **cosine similarity** to analyze:

- 3D vector data from a custom dataset (`distance_dataset.csv`)
- Textual similarity between custom-written sentences using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer

The goal is to understand how cosine similarity measures **directional alignment** between vectors — whether in geometric space or in NLP.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Cosine similarity for 3D points: visualized with `matplotlib` in 3D
- Text vectorization using:
  - `CountVectorizer` (raw word counts)
  - `TfidfVectorizer` (weighted term frequency)
- Cosine similarity between short text documents
- Visualization of cosine similarity scores and vector directions
